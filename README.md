# C-ProjectWithPython
Coding with Python and C++
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving- The project was creating a link between Python and C++ to organize the grocery list that was inputed in text files. Linking the Python with the C++ to make a more abstract and functional code.
What did you do particularly well?- I think I was able to make the code functional and with less code then I could have with any other code and the function of reading the files thouroughly while opening and closing at the right place. I was also able to default and menu and make it customizable.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?- The problem I had was with the IDE and being able to download my Python file, other than that I think I did well and not quite sure what else I can do at this point. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?- The most difficult was the python methods to make sure the were calling into the C++ properly as well as being able to download the code from the IDE. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?- the basics of the C++ and Python coding together will help incorporate my devoloping skills in my next classes. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?- I stayed with the basics rule and did one method at a time, I also created a rough pseudocode to plan it out prior to.
